# Python Essentials for Data Engineers

Code for Blog at: [Python Essentials for Data Engineers](https://www.startdataengineering.com/post/python-for-de/).



## Running the codes

Clone the repo, cd into it and setup the virtual environment as shown below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmirJlr/python_essentials_for_data_engineers.git

cd python_essentials_for_data_engineers

python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run pytest (under ./tests folder) you will need to run the `python -m pytest ./tests` command.

The questions are files with the prefix `-questions.py`, use these as starting points to practice python for data engineering. While the workbooks have solutions, there are multiple ways to do the same thing, and as long as you get the correct answer, you should be good.
